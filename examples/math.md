# Math

## Summary

Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Not a function object.

## Description

Unlike the other global objects, Math is not a constructor. All properties and methods of Math are static. You refer to the constant pi as Math.PI and you call
the sine function as Math.sin(x), where x is the method's argument. Constants are defined with the
full precision of real numbers in JavaScript.

### Math.min

The `Math.min()` function returns the smallest of zero or more numbers.

```javascript
var x = 10, y = -20;

Math.min(x, y) // => -20
```
